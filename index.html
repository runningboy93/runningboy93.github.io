<h2>2016 Presidential Campaign</h2>

April's primaries will soon give way to nominees from the (at least) two most significant American political parties as they move from battling fellow party members in an attempt to secure their party's nomination, to competing against each other to determine who will become the 45th President of the United States on November 8, 2016.</p>

<h5>External Site Feedback</h5>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.democrats.org/">Democrats.org</a> site was picked at random and it's pretty rich in CSS code which I can understand <em>parts</em> of. I see lists and images with alt tags as well as a tags and hrefs but the majority of the work is done styling the page in CSS which I gather from the context of the site (classes, etc.) is how the paint a whole section of a site with a type of formatting predetermined for that section, so it doesn't have to be done individually. </p>
